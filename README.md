# Signal Processing

## EEGLAB Toolbox
You can see the Tutorial video on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DQS0o_t5DI&t=17s

In this video, I will walk you through the basics of EEG signal processing and analysis using the powerful EEGLAB toolbox.

I will begin with a brief introduction to EEG signals. Then, I will introduce you to some analysis software for EEG signals. Finally, I will guide you through the interface and features of EEGLAB, and help you import EEG data, pre-process it, and remove artifacts. By the end of this video, you will have a solid understanding of how to use EEGLAB for your own EEG data analysis projects.
