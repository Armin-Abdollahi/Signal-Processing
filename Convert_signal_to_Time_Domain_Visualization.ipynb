        "### Characteristics of Time-Domain Visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "- Displays how the signal changes over time\n",
        "- Amplitude is typically plotted on the y-axis and time on the x-axis\n",
        "- Useful for analyzing transient responses, wave propagation, and energy flow in circuits and systems\n",
        "- Commonly used with oscilloscopes to view real-world signals in the time domain\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Time-Domain Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- Provides insight into the flow of mechanical and electrical energies in a system\n",
        "- Enables separation of desired signals from extraneous signals like reflections and noise based on timing\n",
        "- Useful for circuit designs with antennas where stray signals need to be identified\n",
